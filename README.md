UPDATE (on 24th June, 2020) : This was a project I was working on when I was 16-17 years old. I had founded largest fan community of a game called Pokemon on Google+ and had decided to make online fan version of the same game. I formed a team of similarly aged persons having varying interests such as programming, graphics designing, story-writing etc. However since we were at crucial age that time, we all had other commitments at that time and one-by-one people had to go. One day, we as team decided to discontinue this project. However I still have code that I wrote during that period, which I've uploaded here. Although we didn't make anything fancy, we learned alot about programming and how to work in a team. The project also made us realise that we had a taken a project bigger than our capabilities at those times, nevertheless the expereince and teaching from this project were worth it.
