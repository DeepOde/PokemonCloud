UPDATE (on 24th June, 2020 by DeepOde) : This was a project I was working on when I was 16-17 years old. I had founded largest fan community of a game called Pokemon on Google+ and had decided to make online fan version of the same game. I formed a team of similarly aged persons having varying interests such as programming, graphics designing, story-writing etc. and another person who had more expereince than us in programming, David Awad, he mostly helped us with creating front interface (landing page) and guided us to use Crafty.js, a JS library which we had used that time. My work mostly invovled creating battle mechanics along with my friend Lorenzo (lolmart), we had tried to mimic the exact battle mechanics used in original Pokemon games, the reference to sites from where those mechanics can be found is in related coding files. <br />

However since all remanining of us were at crucial age that time, we all had other commitments and one-by-one people had to leave the project. One day, we as team decided to discontinue this project. However I still have code that I wrote during that period, which I've uploaded here. Although we didn't make anything fancy, we learned alot about programming and how to work in a team. The project also made us realise that we had a taken a project bigger than our capabilities at those times, nevertheless the expereince and teaching from this project were worth it. ~DeepOde
